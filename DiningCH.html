                Had a quick dinner when rollwd.into Chapel Hill for a lacrosse visit. The service was quick. They were pretty strict that the restaurant closes at 10pm so we had to hurry along. We had a salad.and Brazen Short ribs with the mashed potatoes. It.had a little.asian spice and vegetables. I really.enjoyes the dish. I think priced good. . Would go again if in Chapel Hill. House IPA very very good. <br />

                There was a private party in the main dining area so we were taken to the bar area which was really cool. Great atmosphere. Small and cozy. Cocktails were perfect. We started with the salt and pepper shrimp which are lightly fried in the shell like soft shell crab. Generous portion. I followed with the smoked chicken which was out of this world. My husband had the fried catfish. For dessert we (mainly I) had the hot chocolate cake with ice cream. Gus was our server and he was very attentive. Wonderful 5 star experience. We will be back!!! <br />

            <h3>Jujube</h3>
            <div class="post-time">Oct 28</div>

            <div class="post-content">
                Jujube deserves the 5 star ratings it receives. Despite being in a strip mall, it has a very cozy, well-appointed feel inside. It's a relatively short menu, which I like, but we still had trouble deciding what we wanted because everything sounded so good. We ended up sharing short rib dumplings to start, and shared bulgogi and Kung Pau. Everything was very fresh tasting, with great flavors, and light on the palate. The service was great too, and masks, and covid protocols were well followed.<br />
